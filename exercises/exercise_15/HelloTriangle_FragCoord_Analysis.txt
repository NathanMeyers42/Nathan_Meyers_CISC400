gl_FragCoord exists to hold the coordinate values of the fragment a fragment shader is operating on relative to the window. In HelloTriangle_FragCoord.js, the x and y values obtained from gl_FragCoord are first scaled based on the dimensions of the drawing buffer and those coordinates are used as color values in gl_FragColor. This applies a gradiant over the triangle being rendered that represents the coordinates of a given point on the triangle. (Unsure if this is also relative to the window.)
