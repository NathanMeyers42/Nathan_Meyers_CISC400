A shader is a program that runs on the GPU, which runs a procedure once for every element the procedure modifies in parallel. A vertex shader runs once per vertex in a scene or mesh model and can be used to e.g., update the positions of vertices. A fragment shader is run once per fragment in a buffer, which often means manipulating pixels in an image, but fragment shaders can also be used for other things like lighting or other effects.
